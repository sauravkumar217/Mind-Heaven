# Mind Heaven


## Inspiration
 Only half of all people with mental disorders get the treatment they need.
We have witnessed individuals who were struggling with their mental health but chose not to disclose it to others out of shame. We had considered giving them a means of assistance.
## What it does
Calm The Chaos is a web application for anyone looking to enhance their mental well-being. Our initiative teaches users how to reduce anxiety and stress, and check in with their emotions.
 It features A Journal to help you create order when your world feels like chaos, Relaxing music that decreases the stress effects on your mind and body, Meditation timer that gives you a sense of calm, peace and balance, and 
Yoga guidance to lower stress hormones in body and improve mood.
It allows the user to select the relaxing technique of their choice.

## How we built it
We created our design using Figma first, then used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages. We researched the yoga poses, the kind of music best for mental health and incorporated them into our project.

## Challenges we ran into
It was challenging for us to make a pin for the journal that would retain privacy.
We are pleased with what we accomplished and we are eager to spread this idea, gather feedback, and put it into action to benefit many people.
